# LU Factorization

## This algorithm gereates a LU factorization with a given matrix. 

## Inputs
  - A coefficient matrix. 
  - *Make sure the dimensions agree when inputing. 
  
## Outputs
  - A lower triangular matrix
  - An Upper triangular matrix
  - The permutation matrix (which is the matrix that shows where you pivotied and keeps track of that.)
