# Numerical-Methods-

**Hello there, this page consists of all the different types of algorithms and code I have written so far in my Mechanical Engineering area of study.**

## The three codes I am displaying are:

  - My Simposons 1/3 Rule algorithm
  - My False Postion Algorithm
  - My LU Factorization Algorithm
  
**I hope you enjoy looking through my work!**
