# False Position

## This code generates the root of a function using the False Postion method. 

## The inputs you need are:
  - The function name
  - The max number of iterations you wish for the code to run
  - The relative error wanted
  - The lower guess and upper guess at the root

## The outputs will then be: 
  - The estimated root location
  - The function value evaluated at that root
  - The approximate relative error
  - How many iterations were performed to get to this root
