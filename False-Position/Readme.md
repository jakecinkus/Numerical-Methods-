# False Position

## This code generates the root of a function using the False Postion method. 

## The inputs you need are:
  - The function name, the max number of iterations you wish for the code to run, the relative error wanted, and the lower guess and upper guess at the root. 

## The outputs will then be: 
  - The estimated root location, the function value evaluated at that root, the approximate relative error, and how many iterations were performed to get to this root.
